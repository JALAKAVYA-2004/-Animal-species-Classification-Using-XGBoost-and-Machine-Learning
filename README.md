# Animal-species-Classification-Using-XGBoost-and-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on classifying animal species based on various biological features using machine learning algorithms, with XGBoost as the primary model. The goal is to create a robust and accurate predictive model that can automatically identify species, providing insights into the key characteristics that distinguish different animals.

🐾 Animal Classification Using Machine Learning

📘 Project Overview This project classifies animals into different species using their biological features such as hair, feathers, egg-laying traits, and more.
The goal is to automate and simplify the process of species identification efficiently using a machine learning model.

🧠 Objective To build a machine learning model that predicts the class of an animal based on its physical and biological characteristics using the Zoo dataset.

🧰 Technologies Used

Python
XGBoost
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
📊 Dataset Dataset Name: Zoo Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Description: The dataset contains 101 animals described by 16 Boolean features such as:

Hair
Feathers
Eggs
Milk
Airborne
Aquatic
Predator
and one class type indicating the category of the animal.
